# CZ4125-Project - Travel Planner Application

This is a project done for the CZ4125 Developing Data Products project in NTU in 2022 Y4 Semester 1. 

In this project, our team has developed a travel planner application that allows users to plan their travels quickly and seamlessly by providing a fully planned itinerary route of a travel destination based on the duration of their stay. It also provides suggestions on accommodations near the places of attractions.
